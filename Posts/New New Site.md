Title: New New Site

# New New Site

I have yet again, remade my website. But why? A couple of reasons.

1. Wordpress is WordPress

2. I wanted easy offline-ish posting.

Lets start with number one. Wordpress, it can be a little much.
You have to keep it up to date, keep you extensions up to date. And getting things how I wanted it felt like I was fighting with it. I wanted something simpler.

I also wanted something easier to post from when I have a very slow connection. Every year I take a week long trip out to Deep Creek Lake in Maryland. The internet connections available at the camp ground (Wi-Fi / Cell (1X not LTE)) isn't great. As in, takes 1+ minute to send an iMessage. Ouch. Posting from the lake is a painful thing. With WordPress, I pretty much had to load the web editor (unless I felt like fighting with it to use other methods). Enter my new site. Running on blot.im

I started playing with blot after reading about it from kevq's blog. I really like how with blot, your site is generated from a folder. You can use three methods to sync your folder. Google Drive, Dropbox, or Git. Git, perfect. I can write my posts offline, then just push a tiny commit, and boom, posted. 

I still get nice features with blot, like scheduled posts. I just date the post in the future, and it auto post on the date.

I'm still working on the look, but so far, I like it. And I'm going to move to it from WordPress. It's also cheeper, $4/month vs $5/month (I was self hosting WP in a Linode VM)
