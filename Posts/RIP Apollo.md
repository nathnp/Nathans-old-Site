# RIP Apollo

A couple weeks ago, Reddit announced the new API pricing, and its high, like really high. To the point the third party clients are shutting down. This might be the final nail for a lot of users (myself included). 

Apollo was (one of) the best way to brows reddit on mobile (on iOS). With the new pricing, [Apollo is shutting down](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/). This will kill mobile reddit for me and many many other. 

If this does cause the mass migration users are talking about. I am somewhat excited to see what platform they will choose.

Rest in peace Apollo <3

EDIT: Apollo has shut down as of 6/30/2023
