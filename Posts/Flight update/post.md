# Flight Update

While waiting for my already delayed flight, I got a text saying that I had been rebooked to a new flight...[^1] Later in the day. <br>
I was scheduled to fly from BWI at 13:40 to ATL, then to DEN. Now I'm going from BWI at 15:25 to RDU to DEN... fun. And because I was rebooked, I've been dumped to boarding group C out of... C. It's not all bad, while I'll be stopping in RDU, I'm not changing planes. So I can get a better seat that way. BWI to RDU is only about 1H 5M. Hoping I don't get any more surprises on the flight.
