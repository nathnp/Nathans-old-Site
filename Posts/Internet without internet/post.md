# Internet Without Internet

Currently camping out in the woods with only 68Kbps down of LTE. Pretty much no webpage will load unless Iâ€™m the only one in the campground trying to browse the web. Here are a few tools I've been using to stay connected out here.

[Toot](https://github.com/ihabunek/toot/): A command line Mastodon client

W3m: A command line web browser 

Git: How this website is updated (also command line)

Are you picking up on a theme here?

I have gotten non command line things to work. Ivory, Boring Report both work on my phone (though a little slow). I'm not completely without regular webpages, sometimes I can get sites to load on safari. Sometimes.
