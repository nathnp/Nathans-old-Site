# New Blog

I have a new blog now! 

Now, before you ask, why start a new one when I barely post to this one? It's not a new new blog. It's more of an extension of this one. <br>
The new blog has a gimmick though. It's RSS only. If you want to see new posts, or past posts, you have to use an RSS client.

If you're wondering why, it's because I wanted to. I always liked the idea of a blog post that only goes out over the RSS feed. This site used to have that (back when I used Wordpress on a VM). I'm going to mostly post shorter (but still too long for mastodon) stuff. But we'll see. It's definitely going to be lower key.

If you'd like to learn more here's a link to the [first post](https://rss.nthp.me/2023/09/17/welcome) (Yes, posts are sharable with a link).

Here's the [feed link](rss.nthp.me/feed.rss) if you'd like to subscribe.
