About Me

I'm Nathan, admin of crabland.social

This is my blog. I mostly use this place as a place to post longer form content. Mostly of me rambling of about something.
Posts here will mostly be about things Iâ€™m interested in (aircraft, space, speedcubing, my little pony (yes), computers, etc), or whatever is on my mind.
