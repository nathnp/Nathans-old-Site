# Nathan's-Site

These are the page source files for my website [nthp.me](https://nthp.me). This repo does not include post / page drafts, and a couple other things. This repo will lag behind the live site.

The site is hosted using [blot.im](https://blot.im).

If you spot a typo, open an issue, or hit me up on [Mastodon](https://mstdn.nthp.me/@Nathan) ``` @nathan@mstdn.nthp.me ```

You may not use any of these files for your own purposes. This repo is meant to show how I use Blot, and as an example for those starting to use Blot.

If you would like to link to, or cite a page or post. Link to the main site, not here.
